# bounding_volume_heirachy
A Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) is a data structure used in computer graphics and computational geometry to accelerate spatial queries such as collision detection, ray tracing. The primary goal of a BVH is to organize objects in a scene hierarchically to improve the efficiency of these types of queries.
